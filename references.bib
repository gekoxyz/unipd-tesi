	abstract = {Although Starlink has been deployed for several years, a detailed understanding of system internals is still lacking. In this work we employ precise per-packet timestamps obtained from a hardware-timestamp capable NIC connected to a Starlink terminal.We find that Starlink frame timing details are readily observable at the network layer by analyzing the packet timing patterns.Based on a one-week measurement campaign we collect around half a billion of packet size and timing observations. Processing these observations yields 2.3 million transmission bursts. To learn details on the radio resource management we develop a methodology to infer the effective physical layer sending rate. Our findings show that although Starlink throughput can vary widely over multiple time-scales, there are a small number of fundamental physical layer transmission rates. We employ Gaussian Mixture Modeling to determine 14 such fundamental transmission rates, and relate the obtained rates to previous knowledge of the Starlink OFDMA frame structure. Our empirical observations provide an excellent match for a radio resource configuration where a Starlink frame employs 1000 subcarriers and 287 symbols per frame for user traffic transmission, which for uniform 4-QAM modulation yields a base rate of 430.5 Mbps. This physical layer base rate appears to mostly be varied by multiples of 27 Mbps, in several instances likely by modifying the modulation of a subset of the symbols in multiples of 18 symbols.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the capacity of the Starlink global satellite system is considered and evaluated. We will evaluate using the link budget. The code gain due to the addition of error-correcting coding has been added to the calculation of the link budget. At high frequencies, the orbit height is limited to 340 km. Most of the satellites are planned to be located at this altitude. For lower frequencies, higher orbits can be used: 550 km and 1110 km. To date, the spectral efficiency of possible variations of Starlink is limited to 4.5 bits/Hz. At the time of this writing, there are approximately 3300 Starlink satellites in orbit, which theoretically provides a capacity of about 20 Tbps due to the reduced level of modulation and the use of only one polarization. At the end of the first stage of launching satellites into orbit, the system capacity will be 88.5 Tbps over most of the studied frequency band and it will increase as more satellites are launched into low-earth orbit. Working in the future in dual polarizations with 64QAM and with a planned 11 943 satellites, SpaceX will be able to provide Internet access anywhere in the world with high bandwidth and spectral efficiency.},

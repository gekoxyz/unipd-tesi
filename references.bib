	abstract = {Although Starlink has been deployed for several years, a detailed understanding of system internals is still lacking. In this work we employ precise per-packet timestamps obtained from a hardware-timestamp capable NIC connected to a Starlink terminal.We find that Starlink frame timing details are readily observable at the network layer by analyzing the packet timing patterns.Based on a one-week measurement campaign we collect around half a billion of packet size and timing observations. Processing these observations yields 2.3 million transmission bursts. To learn details on the radio resource management we develop a methodology to infer the effective physical layer sending rate. Our findings show that although Starlink throughput can vary widely over multiple time-scales, there are a small number of fundamental physical layer transmission rates. We employ Gaussian Mixture Modeling to determine 14 such fundamental transmission rates, and relate the obtained rates to previous knowledge of the Starlink OFDMA frame structure. Our empirical observations provide an excellent match for a radio resource configuration where a Starlink frame employs 1000 subcarriers and 287 symbols per frame for user traffic transmission, which for uniform 4-QAM modulation yields a base rate of 430.5 Mbps. This physical layer base rate appears to mostly be varied by multiples of 27 Mbps, in several instances likely by modifying the modulation of a subset of the symbols in multiples of 18 symbols.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the capacity of the Starlink global satellite system is considered and evaluated. We will evaluate using the link budget. The code gain due to the addition of error-correcting coding has been added to the calculation of the link budget. At high frequencies, the orbit height is limited to 340 km. Most of the satellites are planned to be located at this altitude. For lower frequencies, higher orbits can be used: 550 km and 1110 km. To date, the spectral efficiency of possible variations of Starlink is limited to 4.5 bits/Hz. At the time of this writing, there are approximately 3300 Starlink satellites in orbit, which theoretically provides a capacity of about 20 Tbps due to the reduced level of modulation and the use of only one polarization. At the end of the first stage of launching satellites into orbit, the system capacity will be 88.5 Tbps over most of the studied frequency band and it will increase as more satellites are launched into low-earth orbit. Working in the future in dual polarizations with 64QAM and with a planned 11 943 satellites, SpaceX will be able to provide Internet access anywhere in the world with high bandwidth and spectral efficiency.},

Due to the [COVID-19], people all over the world need high-speed Internet connections, and India is one of the world's best copied consumer markets. Starlink has advised its customers around the world, including India, to allow all schools and organizations to access high-speed internet over the 'distance' of satellites and in the nature layer. Daily tasks are done online, and they urgently need high-speed Internet connection. There are demands, there are solutions directly from Sky, but Reliance JIO, Vodafone-Idea, Airtel etc. There are other service providers such as. Use FTTH, mobile networks Road and satellite internet, people are already using the internet, but the speed of the internet could be the turning point. Another point to consider is the price of \$99 and \$499, which may create some problems in the market because the Indian market is price sensitive. Starlink's architecture consists of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which aim to minimize latency and maximize throughput, representing a significant departure from traditional geostationary satellites. In this research article, the author tries to find out what people think about Starlink's other business activities such as announcing products that start providing internet from SKY and competing with manufacturers in the market},

We highlight Starlink's role as a major LEO provider, enhancing connectivity in underserved regions. Our findings reveal that while overall video quality on Starlink matches that of traditional networks, the inherent variability in LEO conditions -- such as throughput fluctuations and packet loss -- leads to an increase in bitrate switches and rebuffers. To further improve the quality of experience for the LEO community, we manipulate existing congestion control and adaptive bitrate streaming algorithms using simulation and real A/B tests deployed on over one million households. Our results underscore the need for video streaming and congestion control algorithms to adapt to rapidly evolving network landscapes, ensuring high-quality service across diverse and dynamic network types.},

	abstract = {Starlink constellations are currently the largest LEO WAN and have seen considerable interest from the research community. In this paper, we use high-frequency and high-fidelity measurements to uncover evidence of hierarchical traffic controllers in Starlink -- a global controller which allocates satellites to terminals and an on-satellite controller that schedules transmission of user flows. We then devise a novel approach for identifying how satellites are allocated to user terminals. Using data gathered with this approach, we measure the characteristics of the global controller and identify the factors that influence the allocation of satellites to terminals. Finally, we use this data to build a model which approximates Starlink's global scheduler. Our model is able to predict the characteristics of the satellite allocated to a terminal at a specific location and time with reasonably high accuracy and at a rate significantly higher than baseline.},

	abstract = {Large low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks such as SpaceX's Starlink constellation promise to deliver low-latency, high-bandwidth Internet access with global coverage. As an alternative to terrestrial fiber as a global Internet backbone, they could potentially serve billions of Internet-connected devices. Currently, operators of CDNs exploit the hierarchical topology of the Internet to place points-of-presence near users, yet this approach is no longer possible when the topology changes to a single, wide-area, converged access and backhaul network. In this paper, we explore the opportunities of points-of-presence for CDNs within the satellite network itself, as it could provide better access latency for users while reducing operational costs for the satellite Internet service providers. We propose four strategies for selecting points-of-presence in satellite constellations that we evaluate through extensive simulation. In one case, we find that replicating web content within satellites can reduce bandwidth use in the constellation by 93\% over an approach without replication in the network, while storing just 0.01\% of all content in individual satellites.},
